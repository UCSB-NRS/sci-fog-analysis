We have aggregated data from a transect of weather stations across the island, many of which were provided by Chris Still. This notebook explores that data, including date ranges covered by site, typical weather conditions, intersite comparisons of fog drip, and temporal trends in fog drip. 



## To Do: 
- Create single preprocessing script for weather station data - currently using notebooks which aren't ideal.
