__[goes-plot-clc](goes-plot-clc.ipynb):__     
Create maps of coastal low clouds (CLC) using GOES CLC dataset. Types of maps include both albedo and binary cloud/no cloud plots aggregated to hourly, monthly, and yearly timescales.

__[insolation-extract-raster-values](insolation-extract-raster-values.ipnyb):__     
Extracts a timeseries of potential solar insolation values from a set of rasters for a given site. Potential solar insolation rasters were generated using _insolation-generate-rasters.ipynb_.

__[insolation-generate-rasters](insolation-generate-rasters.ipynb)__:   
Uses a 1m resolution DTM to generate potential solar insolation for an area.   

__[modis-return-interval](modis-return-interval.ipynb)__:  
Uses the API for USGS's Earthdata Search to get the frequency and timing of MODIS Terra/Aqua captures for Santa Cruz Island.
