__eda-pozo-smo2-humid:__   
Looks at distributions of the Pozo SMO2 site weather data when relative humidity is >90%, with the aim of teasing out when fog occurs vs. doesn't occur at high humidities. 

__eda-sci-weather.ipynb:__    
Explores weather station data across the transect provide by Chris Still, with an emphasis on fog conditions.  

__goes-fog-drip-comparisons:__    
Explores the relationship between fog drip measured by the weather stations and GOES coastal low clouds. 

__interence-fog-envelope:__   
Creates an 'envelope' of conditions during which fog occurs, and assesses how often fog occurs during those conditions. The aim of this was to explore whether we can use standard weather station measurements to infer the presence of fog. 

__inference-ml-evaluation:__   
Applies a simple random forest classifier to the weather station data to try and infer fog presence at a given time.  

__inference-ml-testing:__   
Tests different combinations of parameters for simple machine learning models with the goal of inferring fog presence from standard weather station measurements.
